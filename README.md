# TrustID — Karnataka UBID & Active Business Intelligence Platform

> An integrity-first prototype for Karnataka Commerce & Industry that resolves fragmented government department records into a single trusted business identity, classifies business activity, detects shell entities, and maintains a tamper-evident decision ledger.

**Built for:** AI for Bharat Hackathon — Theme 1: Unified Business Identifier (UBID) and Active Business Intelligence by Karnataka Commerce & Industry

## The Problem

Karnataka's regulatory landscape spans 40+ department systems — Shop Establishment, Factories, Labour, KSPCB, BESCOM, BWSSB, Food Safety, and others. Each was built in isolation, with its own schema, identifiers, and free-text name/address fields. The same business appears as multiple disconnected records:
Sri Lakshmi Precision Tools Pvt Ltd   ← Shop Establishment
S L Precision Tools Private Limited   ← Factories
Lakshmi Precision Tools               ← KSPCB
Sri Lakshmi Precision Tooling         ← Labour
There is no reliable join key. Karnataka Commerce & Industries cannot answer: *how many businesses are actually operating in Peenya today, which sectors, and which haven't been inspected in 18 months?*

## What TrustID Does

**Part A — UBID Assignment**

- Ingests master data from department systems in read-only mode (no source modification)
- Blind-hashes PAN, GSTIN, proprietor and phone at ingestion boundary (privacy gateway)
- Links records using Jaro-Winkler name similarity + address token overlap + hashed identifier equality
- Assigns a Unique Business Identifier (UBID) anchored to PAN/GSTIN where available
- Routes high-confidence matches to auto-link, ambiguous pairs to human review, low-confidence to keep-separate
- Records every decision in a hash-chained tamper-evident audit ledger

**Part B — Activity Intelligence**

- Ingests one-way activity event streams (inspections, renewals, filings, consumption)
- Classifies each UBID as Active / Dormant / Closed / Low Evidence
- Uses recency-weighted signal scoring — absence of signal is surfaced as "Low Evidence," not silently treated as closure
- Produces explainable verdicts with evidence timelines

**Differentiators**

- **Shell entity detection** — flags businesses that share blind-hashed proprietor/phone signals across differently-named entities (GST split scheme pattern)
- **Tamper-evident audit ledger** — every decision is SHA-256 hash-chained; retroactive modification is cryptographically detectable
- **Trust scoring** — composite risk/trust score per UBID based on confidence, activity, and integrity flags
- **Field verification tasks** — officers can generate investigation tasks from suspicious UBIDs
- **Reviewer reopen** — any reviewer decision can be reversed with a full audit trail

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node src/server.js
```

Backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`

The server auto-initializes with synthetic Karnataka business data on startup (no separate seed step needed).

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`

## Synthetic Dataset

The prototype runs on synthetic data representing real Karnataka industrial zones:

- **7 department systems:** Shop Establishment, Factories, Labour, KSPCB, BESCOM, BWSSB, Food Safety
- **15 business records** across 2 Bengaluru PIN codes: 560058 (Peenya) and 560022 (Yeshwantpur)
- **5 business clusters** with name/address variation simulating real department data inconsistencies
- **Shell entity pair:** same blind-hashed proprietor + phone across differently-named entities
- **9 activity events** spanning 2022–2026 to produce Active, Dormant, and Low Evidence classifications

No real business data is used at any point. PAN, GSTIN, proprietor and phone values are blind-hashed at the data ingestion boundary.

## Key Design Decisions

**Why Jaro-Winkler over embeddings?**
Deterministic and explainable. Every score can be traced to specific field comparisons. Government audit requires this — a black-box similarity is not defensible.

**Why blind hashing before matching?**
Satisfies the non-negotiable: hosted LLMs and central matchers never see raw PII. Equality matching happens on SHA-256 hashes only.

**Why a hash-chained ledger instead of a simple audit log?**
A conventional audit log can be modified after the fact. A hash-chained ledger makes retroactive modification cryptographically detectable — which matters when the system is used for regulatory enforcement.

**Why "Low Evidence" instead of treating missing signals as Closed?**
A factory with no KSPCB inspection record is not necessarily dormant — it may simply be under the inspection threshold. Surfacing ambiguity honestly is more valuable to government officers than a confident wrong answer.

## Non-Negotiables Satisfied

| Constraint | How TrustID satisfies it |
|---|---|
| No source system modification | Read-only API/batch ingestion only |
| No hosted LLM on raw PII | Blind hashing at ingestion; no raw values cross the matching boundary |
| Every decision explainable | Jaro-Winkler scores, matched fields, and Shapley-style signal breakdowns on every verdict |
| Every decision reversible | Hash-chained ledger; reviewer decisions can be reopened and overridden |
| Wrong merge more costly than missed one | Conservative thresholds; ambiguous pairs always go to human review |

### Prototype Backend Note

The current submitted prototype uses `backend/src/server.js` as a Windows-safe in-memory Express backend.

Older route files, if present, belong to an earlier SQLite-backed implementation idea and are not required for the final prototype demo. The in-memory backend is the active backend for this submission because it avoids native SQLite installation issues and is easier to run locally and deploy.
